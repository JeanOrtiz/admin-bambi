# ADM2
ADM2 is a simple but useful tool to manage your small store.

It's build using moden web technologies such as [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/), [BuefyJS](https://buefy.org/) and [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/).

Doesn't require internet connection, everything is stored on device using [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API)

> ~~Currently only supports spanish - nicaraguan localization, more localization will be supported in the future~~
